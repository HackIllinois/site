                    All individuals participating in HackIllinois are expected
                    to demonstrate integrity, respect, and professionalism at
                    all times. HackIllinois enforces a zero-tolerance policy
                    toward any form of harassment, discrimination, or
                    exclusionary behavior. This includes, but is not limited to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hate speech or offensive language based on race, gender,
                        sexual orientation, disability, religion, or any other
                        protected characteristic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unwanted physical contact or sexual advances.
                        Intimidation, bullying, or deliberate disruption of
                        another participant’s experience.

                    <li>
                        Any form of harassment, including but not limited to

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>
                    If any incident of harassment or discriminatory behavior is
                    reported, it will be promptly reviewed by HackIllinois
                    staff, and can be escalated by event staff’s discretion.
                    Consequences will be determined on a case-by-case basis, and
                    may include immediate removal from the event and
                    notification of the appropriate university authorities.
